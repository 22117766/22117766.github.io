     <p> This position is for a junior web developer role that will be working for ICT Solutions. The job will require working partly in the office and partly from home, so living locally would be ideal to optimise time management. The reason for these requirements is due to the fundamental skills needed in life, which are mathematics, English and science, as well as the necessary ICT skills for this technology-based job.

     The junior developers will be responsible for developing and maintaining web-based applications and solutions for the company's clients. Strong proficiency in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and familiarity with web frameworks and content management systems would be highly advantageous to being selected.

     In addition to technical expertise, the role will also involve collaborating with the wider development team, participating in project meetings, and working closely with clients to understand their requirements and deliver high quality solutions. The ability to work independently as well as part of a team, coupled with excellent communication and problem solving skills, will be essential for thriving in this position.

     If you possess the necessary qualifications, skills and enthusiasm to excel as a junior web developer at ICT Solutions, we encourage you to apply for this exciting opportunity. Please submit your comprehensive CV, highlighting your relevant experience and achievements on the application page to be considered for this role .</p>
